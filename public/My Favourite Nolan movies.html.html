<h1>My all time favourites of Nolan</h1>

<h2>Dark Knight Trilogy</h2>
<p>Really love how it begins and the growth in the charater arc and background score by Zimmer.</p>

<h2>The Prestige</h2>
<p>The determination and sacrificies for conviction of deception to pull of the final act, which makes it one of the best dramas written.</p>

<h2>Inception</h2>
<p>An absolute mindbender, one of the movies I can re-call which I had to rewatched to understand the complexity of the play . </p>
